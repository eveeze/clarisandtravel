# 5 Fascinating Facts About Hidden Nature Gems in Jogja That Few Know About

Yogyakarta, often called Jogja, has long been a favorite destination for travelers in Indonesia, but for those who are willing to go off the beaten path, Jogja reveals a different kind of charm. While most tourists flock to famous landmarks like **Borobudur Temple**, **Prambanan**, or the lively streets of **Malioboro**, there are untouched pockets of natural beauty waiting to be explored. As someone who has wandered through Jogja’s backroads, I discovered some breathtaking hidden gems, and it was these experiences that changed my entire perception of the region.

Each of these places offers something unique, something special that few tourists have seen. Let me share with you five fascinating places I encountered while exploring the hidden nature spots of Jogja.

## 1. Nglambor Beach: An Underwater Paradise for Snorkelers

My journey began with **Nglambor Beach**, tucked away in the **Gunungkidul** region, about a two-hour drive from Yogyakarta city. I had heard about this beach from a local guide, who told me that it’s nothing like the typical crowded tourist beaches. Intrigued, I made my way there and was instantly captivated by its serene beauty.

Unlike other beaches in Jogja, Nglambor feels untouched. The clear turquoise waters, the vibrant coral reefs, and the tranquility of the place made me feel as if I had stepped into an entirely different world. What makes Nglambor truly special are the two giant turtle-shaped rocks that shield the beach from strong waves. Thanks to these natural barriers, the waters here remain calm, making it perfect for snorkeling.

Swimming among the colorful fish and coral beneath the surface was like diving into a living painting. I spent hours snorkeling, completely losing track of time, amazed by the underwater wonders that lay hidden in this quiet corner of Jogja.

---

## 2. Jomblang Cave: The Heavenly Light Phenomenon in an Ancient Forest

As if the tranquility of Nglambor Beach wasn’t enough, the next day brought me to the awe-inspiring **Jomblang Cave** in **Semanu, Gunungkidul**. This cave is famous for its "heavenly light" phenomenon, and after experiencing it myself, I understood why it’s named as such.

Getting to Jomblang Cave is not for the faint-hearted. You have to descend 60 meters into the cave using a rope, and I must admit, my heart was racing. But once inside, I was speechless. The most magical part of the adventure was witnessing the beam of sunlight that pierced through the cave’s opening, casting a surreal glow on the ancient forest growing below. It was like watching nature create art in real-time. This "heavenly light" only appears for a short time between 10 AM and noon, and I felt incredibly lucky to witness it.

The mystical atmosphere in Jomblang Cave was something I will never forget. Walking among ancient trees inside a cave, bathed in the glow of this rare light, felt like stepping into a fantasy novel.

---

## 3. Sri Gethuk Waterfall: A Hidden Oasis in the Countryside

Leaving behind the caves, my next destination was **Sri Gethuk Waterfall** in **Playen, Gunungkidul**, and it turned out to be one of the most peaceful places I’ve ever visited. Getting to the waterfall involved a small adventure of its own . I had to travel down a river on a bamboo raft, which was a surprisingly calming experience in itself.

When we reached the waterfall, the sound of the water rushing down over the rocks was soothing, and the sight was stunning. The water here flows all year round, even in the dry season, which is rare for waterfalls in this region. The cool mist from the falls was refreshing after the bamboo ride, and I spent some time just sitting by the water, enjoying the quiet and solitude.

The local villagers told me that Sri Gethuk is still somewhat of a hidden treasure, as not many tourists know about it. I found this hard to believe, considering how beautiful and serene it was, but it only made my experience there feel more special.

---

## 4. Panguk Kediwung Hill: Watching the Sunrise Above the Clouds

One of the highlights of my trip was watching the sunrise from **Panguk Kediwung Hill** in **Dlingo, Bantul**. I had to wake up early, but it was worth every moment. The view from the top was unlike anything I had ever seen before.

As I reached the hill before dawn, a blanket of thick fog covered the valley below. The world around me was still and quiet, and as the sun slowly began to rise, the fog turned into a sea of clouds. Standing there, it felt as if I was floating above the clouds, and when the sunlight hit the mist, it created a golden glow that illuminated everything.

There’s something incredibly peaceful about being alone on a mountaintop, watching the sun rise. The colors of the sky, the layers of clouds, and the sheer beauty of nature were beyond words. It was one of those moments where you feel deeply connected to the world around you.

---

## 5. Kedung Pedut: A Tiered Waterfall with Emerald Pools

My final stop was **Kedung Pedut**, a stunning tiered waterfall in **Kulon Progo**. The road to Kedung Pedut was a bit rough, but once I arrived, it felt like finding a hidden sanctuary.

What makes Kedung Pedut stand out are the emerald pools that form at the base of the waterfall. The color of the water changes with the sunlight, creating a magical display of greens and blues. I couldn’t resist jumping into the refreshing pools, and after hours of trekking and exploring, the cool water felt like a reward. 

The locals here were incredibly friendly and told me stories about how the place has been cherished by the community for years. Yet, it still remains mostly undiscovered by the usual tourist crowds, allowing me to enjoy it in peace.
